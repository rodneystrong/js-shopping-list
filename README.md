js-shopping-list
================

A fully responsive shopping list (or to-do list) web app from (kinda) scratch using Javascript, jQuery, bootstrap, and font awesome. 

You can click the checkboxes to mark an item that's been bought (or completed) and click the "x" on the right to remove the item completely.
